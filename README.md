## System Design

A Twitter-style platform built with clean architecture, domain-driven design (DDD), and event-driven architecture. Users can create tweets, follow others, and browse timelines. 

**Features:**

* Tweets: Create tweets and view your own profile timeline.
* Search: Find tweets by keyword.
* Follows & Timelines: Follow users and see their tweets in your home timeline.

**Pluggable Data Layer:**

The clean architecture design keeps business logic independent of infrastructure so databases and search engines can be swapped and compared, enabling side-by-side evaluation of the following different stores:
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* Elasticsearch

This lets you compare search capabilities (e.g., PostgreSQL full-text, MongoDB text indexes, Elasticsearch inverted index) without changing core domain code.

**Event-Driven Architecture:**

Timelines are generated via an event-driven flow: when a user posts a new tweet, an event is emitted; a handler consumes the event and fan-outs the tweet into the timelines of all the authorâ€™s followers. This decouples write paths from read models and keeps timelines fast.
